<h1 id="heightening-powers" class="calibre11">HEIGHTENING POWERS</h1>
<p class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre6">Aura Recognition:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
The First Heightening grants a person the ability to see the Breath auras of others instinctively. This allows them to judge roughly how many Breaths the person contains and the general health of that Breath. Persons without this Heightening have a much more difficult time judging auras directly, and must rely instead on how deeply the colors around a person change when they enter the aura. Without at least the First Heightening, it is impossible for the naked eye to notice an Awakener who has fewer than about thirty Breaths.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Perfect Pitch:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
The Second Heightening grants perfect pitch to those who achieve it.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Perfect Color Recognition:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
While each gained Breath leads a person to greater appreciation of colors, it isn’t until one reaches the Third Heightening that one can instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Perfect Life Sense:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
At the Fourth Heightening, an Awakener’s life sense achieves its maximum strength.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Agelessness:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
At the Fifth Heightening, an Awakener’s resistance to aging and disease reaches its maximum strength. These persons are immune to most toxins, including the effects of alcohol, and most physical ailments. (Such as headaches, diseases, and organ failure.) The person no longer ages, and becomes functionally immortal.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Instinctive Awakening:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
All persons of the Sixth Heightening and above immediately understand and can use basic Awakening Commands without training or practice. More difficult Commands are easier for them to master and to discover.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Breath Recognition:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
Those few persons who have reached the Seventh Heightening gain the ability to recognize the auras of objects, and can tell when something has been Invested with Breath via Awakening.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Command Breaking:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
Any persons of the Eighth Heightening or more gain the ability to override Commands in other Invested objects, including Lifeless. This requires concentration and leaves the Awakener exhausted.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Greater Awakening:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
Persons of the Ninth Heightening are reportedly able to Awaken stone and steel, though doing so requires large Investitures of Breath and specialized Commands. This ability has not been studied or confirmed.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Audible Command:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
Persons of the Ninth Heightening also gain the ability to Awaken objects that they are not physically touching, but that are within the sound of their voice.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Color Distortion:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
At the Tenth Heightening, an Awakener gains the natural and intrinsic ability to bend light around white objects, creating colors from them as if from a prism.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Perfect Invocation:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
Awakeners of the Tenth Heightening can draw more color from the objects they use to fuel their art. This leaves objects drained to white, rather than grey.<br class="calibre3"/>
<strong class="calibre6">Other:</strong><br class="calibre3"/>
There are rumors of other powers granted by the Tenth Heightening that are not understood or have not been made known by those who have achieved it.</p>
