<p><em>11 October, Evening</em>.—Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he
says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.</p>
<p>I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.
Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to
understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition
begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and
lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow
with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of
negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
freedom quickly follows; when however the freedom ceases the change-back
or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.</p>
<p>To-night, when we met she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a
violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few
minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband’s hand
in hers she <span class="join">began:—</span></p>
<p>“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,
dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.” This was to
her husband, whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “In
the morning we go out<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 340]" id="pgepubid00362"><a id="Page_340" title="[Pg 340]"/></span> upon our task, and God alone knows what may be
in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me
with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak
woman, whose soul perhaps is lost—no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
at stake—you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you
know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there
is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!” She looked
appealingly at us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.</p>
<p>“What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. “What is that
way, which we must not—may not—take?”</p>
<p>“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I
once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
did my poor Lucy’s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
that stood in the way, I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die
in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be
done, is God’s will. Therefore, I on my part, give up here the certainty
of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest
things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were all silent,
for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the
others were set, and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better
than any of us what was coming. She <span class="join">continued:—</span></p>
<p>“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note
the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
seriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives, I know,” she went
on quickly; “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’s, and you
can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?” She looked
again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quincey
seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tell
you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this
connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all—even you,
my beloved husband—that, should the time come, you will kill me.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 341]" id="pgepubid00363"><a id="Page_341" title="[Pg 341]"/></span></p>
<p>“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s but it was low and strained.</p>
<p>“When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that
I die that I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
without a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;
or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”</p>
<p>Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her
and taking her hand in his said <span class="join">solemnly:—</span></p>
<p>“I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should to
win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred
and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the
duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all
certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has
come!”</p>
<p>“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
bending over, she kissed his hand.</p>
<p>“I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.</p>
<p>“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her,
wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
his hair, and <span class="join">asked:—</span></p>
<p>“And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”</p>
<p>“You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in
her voice and eyes. “You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest
and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life
and all time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men
have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling
into the hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more
because those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men’s
duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And
oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it
be at the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not
forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved”—she stopped
with a flying blush, and changed her phrase—“to him who had best right
to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make
it a happy memory of my husband’s life<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 342]" id="pgepubid00364"><a id="Page_342" title="[Pg 342]"/></span> that it was his loving hand
which set me free from the awful thrall upon me.”</p>
<p>“Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker
smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
<span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:
this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a
time I myself might be—nay! if the time ever comes, <em>shall</em> be—leagued
with your enemy against you.”</p>
<p>“One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not
vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for
me, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need
to <span class="join">speak:—</span></p>
<p>“I want you to read the Burial Service.” She was interrupted by a deep
groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
heart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day. Whatever may
be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet
thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will, I hope, read it,
for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever—come what may!”</p>
<p>“But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” she said, holding up a warning hand. “I am deeper in death at
this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”</p>
<p>“Oh, my wife, must I read it?” he said, before he began.</p>
<p>“It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he began to
read when she had got the book ready.</p>
<p>“How can I—how could any one—tell of that strange scene, its
solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
sweetness? Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
her husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 343]" id="pgepubid00365"><a id="Page_343" title="[Pg 343]"/></span> service for the Burial
of the Dead. “I—I cannot go on—words—and—v-voice—f-fail <span class="join">m-me!”....</span></p>
<p>She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s coming
relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
of us as we had dreaded.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Jonathan Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>15 October, Varna</em>.—We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,
got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
o’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram
had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel—the
Odessus. The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager
to get on, to care for them. Until the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> comes into
port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour
is coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she
slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is
very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to
hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He
always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the <span class="join">first:—</span></p>
<p>“Nothing; all is dark.” And to the <span class="join">second:—</span></p>
<p>“I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is
high—I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”
It is evident that the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> is still at sea, hastening
on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four
telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
that the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> had not been reported to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 344]" id="pgepubid00366"><a id="Page_344" title="[Pg 344]"/></span> Lloyd’s from
anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should
send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He
was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be
sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.</p>
<p>We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the
Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get
on board between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the
form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man’s form without
suspicion—which he evidently wishes to avoid—he must remain in the
box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;
for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,
before he wakes. What mercy he will get from us will not count for much.
We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the
ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I
think!</p>
<p><em>16 October</em>.—Mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and
when we hear of the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> we shall be ready. As she must
pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p><em>17 October</em>.—Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his
own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the captain to give him
every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also
a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent,
who was much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we
are all satisfied that whatever he can do<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 345]" id="pgepubid00367"><a id="Page_345" title="[Pg 345]"/></span> to aid our wishes will be
done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open.
If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at
once and drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I
shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we
shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’s
body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no
evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But
even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us
and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully
if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out
our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant
the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> is seen, we are to be informed by a special
messenger.</p>
<p><em>24 October</em>.—A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,
but only the same story: “Not yet reported.” Mina’s morning and evening
hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
masts.</p>
<p class="s4 rght5 top2"><em>Telegram, October 24th</em>.</p>
<p class="s4 center"><em>Rufus Smith, Lloyd’s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H.B.M.
Vice-Consul, Varna</em></p>
<p>“<i>Czarina Catherine</i> reported this morning from Dardanelles.”</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>24 October</em>.—How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen
is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with
excitement to-day when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. I know
now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After
all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not
to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 346]" id="pgepubid00368"><a id="Page_346" title="[Pg 346]"/></span>
excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am
sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it;
but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The
lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We
talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It
would break poor Harker’s heart—certainly his nerve—if he knew that
we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells
me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition,
for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no
active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would
be necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have
to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should
neither of us shrink from the task—awful though it be to contemplate.
“Euthanasia” is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to
whoever invented it.</p>
<p>It is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
rate the <i>Czarina Catherine</i> has come from London. She should therefore
arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one
o’clock, so as to be ready.</p>
<p><em>25 October, Noon</em>.—No news yet of the ship’s arrival. Mrs. Harker’s
hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of
excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are as cold as ice,
and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife
which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad look out for the
Count if the edge of that “Kúkri” ever touches his throat, driven by
that stern, ice-cold hand!</p>
<p>Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About
noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
kept silent to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She had
been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually
that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 347]" id="pgepubid00369"><a id="Page_347" title="[Pg 347]"/></span> we went to
her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so
well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder
that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she has
been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he
may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
his doom, I trust!</p>
<p><em>26 October</em>.—Another day and no tidings of the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>.
She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying <em>somewhere</em>
is apparent, for Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as
the ship may now be signalled any moment.</p>
<p><em>27 October, Noon</em>.—Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping
waves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very
faint.” The telegrams from London have been the same: “no further
report.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us. He added <span class="join">significantly:—</span></p>
<p>“I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s. Souls and memories can do
strange things during trance.” I was about to ask him more, but Harker
just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night,
at sunset, to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>28 October</em>.—Telegram. <em>Rufus
Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H.B.M. Vice-Consul, Varna</em></p>
<p>“<i>Czarina Catherine</i> reported entering Galatz at one o’clock to-day.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 348]" id="pgepubid00370"><a id="Page_348" title="[Pg 348]"/></span></p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>28 October</em>.—When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz
I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been
expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose
that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against
ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should
know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels,
even if it be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience, and
we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hands over his head
for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said
not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set.
Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself
half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris
tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our
old wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled—actually smiled—the dark
bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action
belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the
great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start for
Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.</p>
<p>“At 6.30 to-morrow morning!” We all stared, for the answer came from
Mrs. Harker.</p>
<p>“How on earth do you know?” said Art.</p>
<p>“You forget—or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
does Dr. Van Helsing—that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter
I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of
the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle
Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 349]" id="pgepubid00371"><a id="Page_349" title="[Pg 349]"/></span>
learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,
as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.</p>
<p>“Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his
head: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even
if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the
tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do
you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship
just as it was here. Quincey Morris, you see the Vice-Consul, and get
his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay
with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you
may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here
with Madam to make report.”</p>
<p>“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
had been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and
shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting
from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!”
The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to
each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the
time, however.</p>
<p>When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
Harker’s journal at the castle. She went away to get it; when the door
was shut upon her he said to <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“We mean the same! speak out!”</p>
<p>“There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
deceive us.”</p>
<p>“Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”</p>
<p>“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”</p>
<p>“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 350]" id="pgepubid00372"><a id="Page_350" title="[Pg 350]"/></span> want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a
great—a terrible—risk; but I believe it is right. In the moment
when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an
inspiration come to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his
spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box
in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He
learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.
Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.
He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
but he cut her off—take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that
so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that
have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will
come higher than his child-brain that he in his tomb for centuries, that
grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore
small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance! She know
it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want
all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain
which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a
special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away
altogether—though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never
feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”</p>
<p>I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets
of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face
brightening up as he read. Then, holding the pages between his finger
and thumb, he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already—and you too,
dear Madam Mina, that are young—here is a lesson: do not fear ever to
think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to
let him loose his wings.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 351]" id="pgepubid00373"><a id="Page_351" title="[Pg 351]"/></span> Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to
where that half-thought come from, and I find that he be no half-thought
at all; that he be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friend
Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that
sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I
read here what Jonathan have <span class="join">written:—</span></p>
<p>“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought
his forces over the Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was
beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come
alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”</p>
<p>“What does this tell us? Not much! no! The Count’s child-thought see
nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my
man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word
from some one who speak without thought because she too know not what
it mean—what it <em>might</em> mean. Just as there are elements which rest,
yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch—then
pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven’s wide, that blind and
kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues
and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you
ever study the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes;
for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch
you not—not but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not <i lang="la">a
particulari ad universale</i>. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It
is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who
know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that <em>it
is</em>. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime—that
is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of
none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and
cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He
be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate
to crime also; he too have child-brain, and it is of the child to do
what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal
learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then
there is to him the ground<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 352]" id="pgepubid00374"><a id="Page_352" title="[Pg 352]"/></span> to start from to do more. ‘<i>Dos pou sto</i>,’
said Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do
once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until
he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every
time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are
opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for
Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands, and her eyes sparkled. He went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
those so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
unconsciously, as she <span class="join">spoke:—</span></p>
<p>“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso
would so classify him, and <i lang="la">qua</i> criminal he is of imperfectly formed
mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past
is a clue, and the one page of it that we know—and that from his own
lips—tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a
‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he had
tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
for a new effort. He came again, better equipped for his work; and won.
So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all
hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over
the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube
from Turkey land.”</p>
<p>“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later
he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room
<span class="join">consultation:—</span></p>
<p>“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to
her again, he said with keen <span class="join">expectation:—</span></p>
<p>“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
Speak, without fear!”</p>
<p>“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”</p>
<p>“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”</p>
<p>“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 353]" id="pgepubid00375"><a id="Page_353" title="[Pg 353]"/></span> small
and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,
leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being
safe, careless of all. So, his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat of
the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night. I
felt it, Oh! I felt it. Thank God for His great mercy! My soul is freer
than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a
fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his
ends.” The Professor stood <span class="join">up:—</span></p>
<p>“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from
us. But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is
in God’s Providence, the very thing that the evil doer most reckoned
on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter
is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he
think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us
with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him
to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your
mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail!
That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to
him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when
the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by
his; and this power to good of you and others, you have won from your
suffering at his hands. This is now all more precious that he know it
not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge
of our where. We, however, are not all selfish, and we believe that God
is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours. We
shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves
that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it
have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write
him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can
give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”</p>
<p>And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.</p>

<p><em>29 October</em>.—This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us
had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
more strenuous effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer <span class="join">came:—</span></p>
<p>“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only
a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear
men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air
blowing upon me.”</p>
<p>Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting
a weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
Harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his kúkri. There
was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was
passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 355]" id="pgepubid00378"><a id="Page_355" title="[Pg 355]"/></span> Suddenly she
sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said <span class="join">sweetly:—</span></p>
<p>“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” We
could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get
tea; when she had gone Van Helsing <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“You see, my friends. <em>He</em> is close to land; he has left his
earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie
hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be
in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at
Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be
carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may
discover what the box contains. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore
to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. We
may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on
him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true
self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”</p>
<p>There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.</p>
<p>Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole
soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made <span class="join">reply:—</span></p>
<p>“All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
of wood on wood.” She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till
to-night.</p>
<p>And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more
hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw
more light on what is happening.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 356]" id="pgepubid00379"><a id="Page_356" title="[Pg 356]"/></span> a time
when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count’s
sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance
hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes
on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count’s power
over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did
speak, her words were <span class="join">enigmatical:—</span></p>
<p>“Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can
hear, far off, confused sounds—as of men talking in strange tongues,
fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” She stopped, and a
shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,
till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even
in answer to the Professor’s imperative questioning. When she woke from
the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
silence.</p>
<p><em>30 October, 7 a.m.</em>—We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to
write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no
effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor
lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal <span class="join">quickness:—</span></p>
<p>“All is dark. I hear the water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a
queer one like—” she stopped and grew white, and whiter still.</p>
<p>“Go on; Go on! Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an agonized
voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen
sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker’s pale face. She opened her eyes,
and we all<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 357]" id="pgepubid00380"><a id="Page_357" title="[Pg 357]"/></span> started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the <span class="join">utmost
concern:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t? I don’t remember
anything.” Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
turning from one to the other with a troubled <span class="join">look:—</span></p>
<p>“What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was
lying here, half asleep, and I heard you say ‘go on! speak, I command
you!’ It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad
child!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed,
of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more
earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I
am proud to obey!”</p>
<p>The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with
anxiety and eagerness.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>30 October</em>.—Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since
he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed
much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
Vice-Consul as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two
doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
of the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the
Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Jonathan Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>30 October</em>.—At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I
called on Messrs Mackenzie &amp; Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm
of Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
Godalming’s telegraphed request, asking them to show us any civility
in their power. They were<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 358]" id="pgepubid00381"><a id="Page_358" title="[Pg 358]"/></span> more than kind and courteous, and took us
at once on board the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>, which lay at anchor out in
the river harbour. There we saw the captain, Donelson by name, who told
us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so
favourable a run.</p>
<p>“Man!” he said, “but it made us afeared, for we expeckit that we should
have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the
average. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind
ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his
ain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh
a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us,
till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could
we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we
came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
never were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if
the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to
do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no
to our miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old
Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
hinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
he know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with the
compliment, and went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them,
the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had
been put on board by a queer-lookin’ old man just before we had started
frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the
supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot
their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us,
I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it
was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up
for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 359]" id="pgepubid00382"><a id="Page_359" title="[Pg 359]"/></span>
get somewheres—well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t,
well, we’d keep a sharp look out anyhow. Sure enuch, we had a fair way
and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun
came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite
Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take
out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it
wi’ a handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck, wi’ his
head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye,
the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in
the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, and as it was marked Galatz <i lang="la">via</i> Varna, I thocht I’d let it
lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t athegither. We didn’t
do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in
the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboord
wi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for
one Count Dracula. Sure enuch the matter was one ready to his hand. He
had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to be rid o’ the dam’ thing, for
I was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any
luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it was nane ither than that same!”</p>
<p>“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing, with
restrained eagerness.</p>
<p>“I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” he answered, and, stepping down to his
cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse
16 was the address. We found out that this was all the captain knew; so
with thanks we came away.</p>
<p>We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were pointed
with specie—we doing the punctuation—and with a little bargaining
he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but important.
He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to
receive, if possible before sunrise, so as to avoid customs, a box
which would arrive at Galatz in the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>. This he was to
give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with Slovaks who
traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by an
English<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 360]" id="pgepubid00383"><a id="Page_360" title="[Pg 360]"/></span> bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to
the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all
he knew.</p>
<p>We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had
gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated
by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten
and eleven o’clock last night. We were at a standstill again.</p>
<p>Whilst we were talking, one came running and breathlessly gasped
out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the
churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if
by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the
horror, the women crying out, “This is the work of a Slovak!” We hurried
away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so
detained.</p>
<p>As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all
convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home
to the hotel to Mina.</p>
<p>When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina
again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at
least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
released from my promise to her.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>30 October, evening</em>.—They were so tired and worn-out and dispirited
that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked
them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything
up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the
“Traveller’s” typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.
I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write with a
<span class="join">pen....</span></p>
<p>It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
breathe, and his whole body appears<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 361]" id="pgepubid00384"><a id="Page_361" title="[Pg 361]"/></span> in collapse. His brows are knit;
his face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I
can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts.
Oh! if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I <span class="join">can....</span></p>
<p>I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that
I have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all
carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to
follow the Professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the facts
before <span class="join">me....</span></p>
<p>I do believe that under God’s Providence I have made a discovery. I
shall get the maps and look over <span class="join">them....</span></p>
<p>I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready,
so I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is
well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2"><em>Mina Harker’s Memorandum</em>.</p>
<p class="center bottom1">(Entered in her Journal.)</p>
<p><em>Ground of inquiry</em>.—Count Dracula’s problem is to get back to his own
place.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) He must be <em>brought back</em> by some one. This is evident; for, had
he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or
wolf, or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be—confined
as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <em>How is he to be taken?</em>—Here a process of exclusion may help us.
By road, by rail, by water?</p>
<p>1. <em>By Road</em>.—There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving a
city.</p>
<p>(<i>x</i>) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,
a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.</p>
<p>(<i>y</i>) There are, or there might be, customs and octroi officers to pass.</p>
<p>(<i>z</i>) His pursuers might follow. This is his greatest fear; and in order
to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
his victim—me!</p>
<p>2. <em>By Rail</em>.—There is no one in charge of the box. It<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 362]" id="pgepubid00385"><a id="Page_362" title="[Pg 362]"/></span> would have to
take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
on the track. True, he might escape at night; but where would he be, if
left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not
what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.</p>
<p>3. <em>By Water</em>.—Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even
then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were
he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would
indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would
still be desperate.</p>
<p>We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do
is to ascertain <em>what</em> water.</p>
<p>The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,
then, get a light on what his later task is to be.</p>
<p><em>Firstly</em>.—We must differentiate between what he did in London as part
of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had
to arrange as best he could.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em> we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
know of, what he has done here.</p>
<p>As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
The proof of this is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
Hildesheim to clear and take away the box <em>before sunrise</em>. There is
also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. This we must only guess at;
but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
Hildesheim.</p>
<p>That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The <i>Czarina Catherine</i>
made a phenomenally quick journey—so much so that Captain Donelson’s
suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
played the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
Count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it—and here
we lose the trail. We<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 363]" id="pgepubid00386"><a id="Page_363" title="[Pg 363]"/></span> only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
avoided.</p>
<p>Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival—<em>on
land</em>, at Galatz.</p>
<p>The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
aid in the work? In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s
remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.</p>
<p>My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
Castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from
the Castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
by murdering his agent.</p>
<p>I have examined the map, and find that the river most suitable for the
Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling
level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
was on a river in an open boat—propelled probably either by oars or
poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There
would be no such sound if floating down stream.</p>
<p>Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza,
which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
close to Dracula’s Castle as can be got by water.</p>

<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal—continued</em>.</p>
<p>When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have seen where
we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we
may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he
is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry
him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
him in the stream, where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now,
men, to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each
and all shall do.”</p>
<p>“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.</p>
<p>“And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr.
Morris.</p>
<p>“Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neither must go alone. There
must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
rough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongst them
they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. <span class="join">Morris:—</span></p>
<p>“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd,
and there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.” Dr.
Seward <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come
along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
Slovaks, and a chance thrust—for I don’t suppose these fellows carry
guns—would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time;
we shall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated,
and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as
he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
torn about in his mind.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 365]" id="pgepubid00388"><a id="Page_365" title="[Pg 365]"/></span> Of course he wanted to be with me; but then
the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the
... the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing <span class="join">spoke:—</span></p>
<p>“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at
the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him—that—which
has wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina;
she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to
run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be,
or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can
fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men.
Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming,
and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river,
and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might
be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s
country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
stream whence he cannot escape to land—where he dares not raise the lid
of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish—we shall go in the track where Jonathan went—from Bistritz over
the Borgo—and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina’s
hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way—all dark and
unknown otherwise—after the first sunrise when we near that fateful
place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify,
so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here Jonathan interrupted
him <span class="join">hotly:—</span></p>
<p>“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right
into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
Hell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
infamy—with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and ever speck
of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have you
felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?” Here he turned to me,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 366]" id="pgepubid00389"><a id="Page_366" title="[Pg 366]"/></span> and as
his eyes lit on my forehead, he threw up his arms with a cry: “Oh, my
God, what have we done to have this terror upon us?” and he sank down on
the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as he spoke in
clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us <span class="join">all:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that
place. There is work—wild work—to be done there, that her eyes may not
see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with our own eyes what
is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in
terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time—and he is strong and
subtle and cunning—he may choose to sleep him for a century; and then
in time our dear one”—he took my hand—“would come to him to keep
him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You
have told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as
they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder;
and well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
if need be, my life? If it were that anyone went into that place to
stay, it is I who would have to go, to keep them company.”</p>
<p>“Do as you will;” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “We
are in the hands of God!”</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men
worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so
true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of
money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it
do when basely used! I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could
not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
of us was to do; now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam
launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment’s notice. Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris have half a dozen beautiful horses, well appointed. We
have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.
Professor Van Helsing and I are to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 367]" id="pgepubid00390"><a id="Page_367" title="[Pg 367]"/></span> leave by the 11.40 train to-night
for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.
We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage
and horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can
trust in this matter. The Professor knows something of a great many
languages, so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for
me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed
like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar
on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling
me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
warnings.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may
never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;
his look is a warning. There must be no tears now—unless it may be that
God will let them fall in gladness.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Jonathan Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>October 30. Night</em>.—I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch; Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
plans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if
any waterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the
Sereth, and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We
took it that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be
the place chosen for crossing the country between the river and the
Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at
night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart
to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells
me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to
be on watch. But I cannot sleep—how can I with the terrible danger
hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My
only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith
it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the
trouble. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 368]" id="pgepubid00391"><a id="Page_368" title="[Pg 368]"/></span> on their long ride before
we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get
on higher lands, where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid
the following of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men
to ride and lead their spare horses—four in all, so as not to excite
curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which will be shortly, they will
themselves look after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join
forces; if so they can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a
movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.</p>
<p>It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
furnace <span class="join">door....</span></p>
<p><em>31 October</em>.—Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is
sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
prayed.</p>
<p><em>1 November, evening</em>.—No news all day; we have found nothing of the
kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are
wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have overhauled every boat,
big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government
boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing
matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
have overhauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
we could not hear of any such boat,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 369]" id="pgepubid00392"><a id="Page_369" title="[Pg 369]"/></span> so she must have passed there in
the night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to
tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists
that he shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness
to poor dear Mina and me.</p>
<p><em>2 November, morning</em>.—It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not
wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept so peacefully
and was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish of me to have
slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am
a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can
do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back
to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have
got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to
get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard,
they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I
am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but
we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder
how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
streams running down from the mountains into this river, but as none of
them are very large—at present, at all events, though they are terrible
doubtless in winter and when the snow melts—the horsemen may not have
met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
necessary to take counsel together what to do next.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>2 November</em>.—Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it
if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the
rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;
we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.</p>
<p><em>3 November</em>.—We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the
Bistritza. I wish it wasn’t so cold. There are signs<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 370]" id="pgepubid00393"><a id="Page_370" title="[Pg 370]"/></span> of snow coming;
and if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge
and go on, Russian fashion.</p>
<p><em>4 November</em>.—To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
accident when trying to force a way up the rapid. The Slovak boats get
up all right, by aid of a rope, and steering with knowledge. Some went
up only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they
got up the Rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
peasantry tell us that after she got upon the smooth water again, she
kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must
push on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>31 October</em>.—Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that
this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize me at all, and that all
I could say was: “Dark and quiet.” He is off now buying a carriage and
horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so
that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more
than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting;
if only it were under different conditions, how delightful it would be
to see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a
pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of
their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
people! But, <span class="join">alas!—</span></p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and
horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The
landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to
me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has
been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats
and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of
our being cold.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>
<p>We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are
truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,
with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over
my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I
loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and
truest thought will be always for him.</p>

<p><em>1 November</em>.—All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed.
The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they
go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
of nice qualities. They are very, very superstitious. In the first
house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting
an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can’t abide garlic.
Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and
so have escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we
have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I
daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the
way. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest,
though he made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotized
me, and he says that I answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and
creaking wood;” so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think
of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I
write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready.
Dr.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 373]" id="pgepubid00397"><a id="Page_373" title="[Pg 373]"/></span> Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old
and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror’s; even in his
sleep he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must
make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before
us, and he must not break down when most of all his strength will be
needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.</p>
<p><em>2 November, morning</em>.—I was successful, and we took turns driving all
night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange
heaviness in the air—I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
“darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing
as they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
danger—more than need be; but we are in God’s hands.</p>
<p><em>2 November, night</em>.—All day long driving. The country gets wilder as
we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed
so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves.
Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass.
The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last
horses we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to
change. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we
have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they
give us no trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so
even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want
to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn.
Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my
poor darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright,
and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us
both, and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in
His sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may
deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not
incurred His wrath.</p>

<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing</em>.</p>
<p><em>4 November</em>.—This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D.,
of Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It
is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
alive—Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She, who is usual
so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
However, to-night she is more <i lang="fr">vif</i>. Her long sleep all day have refresh
and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,
God’s will be done—whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!</p>
<p>Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography,
I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
unrecorded.</p>
<p>We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I
saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our
carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual,
but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then
she woke, bright and radiant, and we go on our way and soon reach the
Pass. At this time and place she become all on fire with zeal; some new
guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and <span class="join">say:—</span></p>
<p>“This is the way.”</p>
<p>“How know you it?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Of course I know it,” she answer, and with a pause, add: “Have not my
Jonathan travel it and wrote of his travel?”</p>
<p>At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 375]" id="pgepubid00399"><a id="Page_375" title="[Pg 375]"/></span> there be only
one such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the
coach road from Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
more of use.</p>
<p>So we came down this road; when we meet other ways—not always were we
sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
have fallen—the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan
have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself
to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I
may not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I
harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
all—in—all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
it were the end of the world.</p>
<p>Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
first enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear.
I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already—that
she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
help me and I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 376]" id="pgepubid00400"><a id="Page_376" title="[Pg 376]"/></span> eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget
all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her
lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once,
twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning.
When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
obedient, she may not sleep. The run rise up, and up, and up; and then
sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I
have to lift her up and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and sleep;
and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And
I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!—I am afraid of all
things—even to think; but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is
life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.</p>
<p><em>5 November, morning</em>.—Let me be accurate in everything, for though
you and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first
think that I, Van Helsing, am mad—that the many horrors and the so long
strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.</p>
<p>All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seemed to have
held sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though
I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her—even for food.
I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted
as she is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself, “if it
be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep
at night.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient
and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I
waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina
still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the
frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such as castle as Jonathan
tell of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or
ill, the end was near. I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise
her; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came
upon us—for<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 377]" id="pgepubid00401"><a id="Page_377" title="[Pg 377]"/></span> even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on
the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight—I took out the
horses and fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and
near it I made Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit
comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat,
simply saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her
unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for
all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big
for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed
some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She
sat still all the time—so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and
ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But
when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul
shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said
to her presently, when she had grown more <span class="join">quiet:—</span></p>
<p>“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test of
what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she
stopped, and stood as one stricken.</p>
<p>“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down
in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from
sleep, she said <span class="join">simply:—</span></p>
<p>“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be
danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!</p>
<p>Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till
I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them,
they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet
for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it
arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time
my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to
die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow
came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there
was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as
though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women
with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 378]" id="pgepubid00402"><a id="Page_378" title="[Pg 378]"/></span> trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence, only that the
horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to
fear—horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that
ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and
all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s
horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy
glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses
cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even
the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away.
I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and
circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held
me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low
it <span class="join">was:—</span></p>
<p>“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and
looking in her eyes, <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed—a laugh low
and unreal, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Fear for <em>me</em>! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them
than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of
wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the
wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise, till—if God have not
take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes—there were before
me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room,
when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms,
the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came
through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were
of the intolerable sweetness of the <span class="join">water-glasses:—</span></p>
<p>“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 379]" id="pgepubid00403"><a id="Page_379" title="[Pg 379]"/></span> turned to my poor
Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I
seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and
laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for
I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach
me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring,
which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses
had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them
softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts
no more of terror.</p>
<p>And so we remained till the red of the dawn began to fall through the
snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror;
but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me
again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
towards the castle, and were lost.</p>
<p>Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending
to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have
made my fire and have seen the horses; they are all dead. To-day I have
much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
obscure it, will be to me a safety.</p>
<p>I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her
<span class="join">sleep....</span></p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Jonathan Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>4 November, evening</em>.—The accident to the launch has been a terrible
thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,
off on the wolds near that<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 380]" id="pgepubid00404"><a id="Page_380" title="[Pg 380]"/></span> horrid place. We have got horses, and we
follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We
have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean to fight. Oh, if only
Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more,
Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>5 November</em>.—With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing
away from the river with their leiter-waggon. They surrounded it in a
cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly
and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own excited
feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,
and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,
or where, or what, or when, or how it may <span class="join">be....</span></p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Van Helsing’s Memorandum</em>.</p>
<p><em>5 November, afternoon</em>.—I am at least sane. Thank God for that
mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I
left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the
castle. The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti
was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty
hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
being entered I might not get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience served
me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for
I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if
there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either
there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
The dilemma had me between his horns. Her, I had not dare to take into
this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet
even there would be the wolf! I resolve<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 381]" id="pgepubid00405"><a id="Page_381" title="[Pg 381]"/></span> me that my work lay here, and
that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God’s Will. At any rate
it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it
but been for myself the choice had been easy; the maw of the wolf were
better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to
go on with my work.</p>
<p>I knew that there were at least three graves to find—graves that are
inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in
her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder
as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time,
when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as
mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he
delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of
the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on, and on, till
sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of
the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
kiss—and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire
fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...</p>
<p>There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence
of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and
heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved—I, Van Helsing,
with all my purpose and with my motive for hate—I was moved to a
yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog
my very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it
was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound
of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.</p>
<p>Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not
pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should
begin to be enthral; but I go on searching until, presently, I find
in a high great tomb as if<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 382]" id="pgepubid00406"><a id="Page_382" title="[Pg 382]"/></span> made to one much beloved that other fair
sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the
atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful,
so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which
calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head
whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear
Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be
wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this
time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell;
and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in
the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.
There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
nobly proportioned. On it was but one word</p>
<p class="s4 center">DRACULA.</p>
<p>This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more
were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
awful work, I laid in Dracula’s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.</p>
<p>Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it
had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had
been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives?...</p>
<p>Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by
thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of
fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though
till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen
the repose in the first face, and the gladness that stole over it just
ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have
endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and
left my work undone.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 383]" id="pgepubid00407"><a id="Page_383" title="[Pg 383]"/></span> But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity
them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of
death, for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my
knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away
and crumble into its native dust, as though the death that should have
come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud
“I am here!”</p>
<p>Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
the Count enter there Un-Dead.</p>
<p>When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her
sleep, and seeing me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.</p>
<p>“Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my
husband, who is, I know, coming towards us.” She was looking thin and
pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was
glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
fresh horror of that ruddy Vampire sleep.</p>
<p>And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
our friends—and <em>him</em>—whom Madam Mina tell me that she <em>know</em> are
coming to meet us.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>6 November</em>.—It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We
did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to
take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility
of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take
some of our provisions too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so
far as we could see through the snow-fall, there was not even the sign
of a habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the
heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where
the clear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep
under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
on any side. There was something wild<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 384]" id="pgepubid00408"><a id="Page_384" title="[Pg 384]"/></span> and uncanny about the place. We
could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the
sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about
that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we
could trace it through the drifted snow.</p>
<p>In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined
him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,
with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by
the hand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter;
and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in
our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions
and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so
was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I
could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not
reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top
of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called <span class="join">out:—</span></p>
<p>“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the
rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling
more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the
snow flurries, and I could see a long way round. From the height where
we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the
white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far
off—in fact so near that I wondered we had not noticed before—came a
group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart,
a long leiter-waggon, which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail
wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the
snow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they were
peasants or gipsies of some kind.</p>
<p>On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for
I felt that the end was coming. The evening<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 385]" id="pgepubid00409"><a id="Page_385" title="[Pg 385]"/></span> was now drawing close, and
well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned
there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude
all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,
however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last
night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, <span class="join">saying:—</span></p>
<p>“At least you shall be safe here from <em>him</em>!” He took the glasses
from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below
us. “See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses,
and galloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollow
<span class="join">voice:—</span></p>
<p>“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will be
done!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his
glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden <span class="join">cry:—</span></p>
<p>“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look, before the
snow blots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr.
Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was
Jonathan. At the same time I <em>knew</em> that Jonathan was not far off;
looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other
men, riding at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan,
and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too,
were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the Professor he
shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a
snowfall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for
use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. “They are all
converging,” he said. “When the time comes we shall have the gipsies
on all sides.” I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we
were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the
snowstorm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the
snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun
shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain
tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots
moving singly and in twos<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 386]" id="pgepubid00410"><a id="Page_386" title="[Pg 386]"/></span> and threes and larger numbers—the wolves
were gathering for their prey.</p>
<p>Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in
fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us
in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before
us; but at others as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
sun would set.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour
that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to
converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter
sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the
snow-clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We
could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and
the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realize,
or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to
hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the
mountain tops.</p>
<p>Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind
our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined
that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our
presence.</p>
<p>All at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my Jonathan’s,
raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’s strong resolute
tone of quiet command. The gipsies may not have known the language,
but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the
other. The leader of the gipsies, a splendid looking fellow, who sat
his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave
to his companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses, which
sprang forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and
in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr.
Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
Seeing<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 387]" id="pgepubid00411"><a id="Page_387" title="[Pg 387]"/></span> that they were surrounded, the men tightened their reins and
drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of
the gipsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held
himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.</p>
<p>The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out
in front, and pointing first to the sun—now close down on the
hill-tops—and then to the castle, said something which I did not
understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from
their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible
fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle
must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but
only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing a quick movement of
our parties, the leader of the gipsies gave a command; his men instantly
formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
order.</p>
<p>In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it
was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the
levelled weapons or the flashing knives of the gipsies in front, or the
howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention.
Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose,
seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered
aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and,
with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung
it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to
use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time
I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my
eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of
the gipsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He
had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he
too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who
had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he
was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his
fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 388]" id="pgepubid00412"><a id="Page_388" title="[Pg 388]"/></span> for as Jonathan, with
desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prise off
the lid with his great kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically
with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield;
the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was
thrown back.</p>
<p>By this time the gipsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made
no further resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and
the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count
lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen
image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I
knew too well.</p>
<p>As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
turned to triumph.</p>
<p>But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’s great knife.
I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
moment Mr. Morris’ bowie knife plunged in the heart.</p>
<p>It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
our sight.</p>
<p>I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
dissolution there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could
have imagined might have rested there.</p>
<p>The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
setting sun.</p>
<p>The gipsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away
as if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the
leiter-waggon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The
wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake,
leaving us alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I
flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the
two doctors.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 389]" id="pgepubid00413"><a id="Page_389" title="[Pg 389]"/></span> Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back
his head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort,
my hand in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the
anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!” he cried
suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, “It was
worth this to die! Look! look!”</p>
<p>The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse
the men sank on their knees, and a deep and earnest “Amen” broke from
all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger as the dying man
<span class="join">spoke:—</span></p>
<p>“Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not
more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!”</p>
<p>And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
gallant gentleman.</p>
<p class="s4 center p4 bottom1">NOTE.</p>
<p>Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It
is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy’s birthday is the same
day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
secret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed into
him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
we call him Quincey.</p>
<p>In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went
over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things
which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The
castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 390]" id="pgepubid00414"><a id="Page_390" title="[Pg 390]"/></span></p>
<p>When we got home we got to talking of the old time—which we could all
look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily
married. I took the papers from the safe where they have been ever since
our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the
mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
authentic document; nothing but a mass of type-writing, except the later
note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing’s memorandum.
We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as
proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with
our boy on his <span class="join">knee:—</span></p>
<p>“We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day
know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her
sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so
loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”</p>
