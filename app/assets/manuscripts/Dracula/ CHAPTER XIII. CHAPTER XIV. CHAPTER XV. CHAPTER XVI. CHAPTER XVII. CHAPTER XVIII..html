<p>I stood beside Van Helsing, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”</p>
<p>He turned to me, and said with grave <span class="join">solemnity:—</span></p>
<p>“Not so! alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”</p>
<p>When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and <span class="join">answered:—</span></p>
<p>“We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”</p>

<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1">D<span class="smaller">R</span>. S<span class="smaller">EWARD</span>’<span class="smaller">S</span> D<span class="smaller">IARY</span>—<em>continued</em>.</p>
<p>The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
afflicted—or blessed—with something of his own obsequious suavity.
Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
from the <span class="join">death-chamber:—</span></p>
<p>“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to
attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
establishment!”</p>
<p>I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible
from the disordered state of things in the household. There were no
relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend
at his father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should
have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it
upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over
Lucy’s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more—such
as this.”</p>
<p>As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 167]" id="pgepubid00179"><a id="Page_167" title="[Pg 167]"/></span></p>
<p>“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself
search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
the hands of strangers.”</p>
<p>I went on with my part of the work, and in another half-hour had found
the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to
him. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions
regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, <span class="join">saying:—</span></p>
<p>“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
you.”</p>
<p>“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he <span class="join">replied:—</span></p>
<p>“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
have, all that there was—only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
his sanction, I shall use some.”</p>
<p>When we had finished the work in hand, he said to <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”</p>
<p>Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
<i lang="fr">chapelle ardente</i>. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over
and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us,
the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All
Lucy’s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had
passed, instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but
restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
that I was looking at a corpse.</p>
<p>The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 168]" id="pgepubid00180"><a id="Page_168" title="[Pg 168]"/></span> to me: “Remain till I
return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
took from his neck, inside his collar, a little golden crucifix, and
placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
came away.</p>
<p>I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
door, he entered, and at once began to <span class="join">speak:—</span></p>
<p>“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
knives.”</p>
<p>“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen
with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that
make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John,
that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for
Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,
and he will want to see her—to see <em>it</em>. Then, when she is coffined
ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation; and then replace
all, so that none know, save we alone.”</p>
<p>“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and
nothing to gain by it—no good to her, to us, to science, to human
knowledge—why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”</p>
<p>For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
<span class="join">tenderness:—</span></p>
<p>“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err—I am but
man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 169]" id="pgepubid00181"><a id="Page_169" title="[Pg 169]"/></span> these causes that you
send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love—though she was
dying—and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!</p>
<p>“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
not perhaps well. And if I work—as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust—without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart, and feel,
oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused
a moment, and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and
terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
a good end. Will you not have faith in me?”</p>
<p>I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage—she had
her back towards me, so did not see me—and go into the room where Lucy
lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
might not be lonely till laid to eternal <span class="join">rest....</span></p>
<p>I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
<span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
impressed me.</p>
<p>“Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late—or too early. See!” Here he
held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 170]" id="pgepubid00182"><a id="Page_170" title="[Pg 170]"/></span></p>
<p>“How stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”</p>
<p>“Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did, and thus
unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”</p>
<p>He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
new puzzle to grapple with.</p>
<p>The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand &amp; Lidderdale. He was very genial
and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
entailed property of Lucy’s father which now, in default of direct
issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
told us so much he went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry
out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept.
We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred
we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our
judgment. Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other
form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of
her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have
come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived
her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
will—and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case—have
been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case, Lord
Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the
world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon
their<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 171]" id="pgepubid00183"><a id="Page_171" title="[Pg 171]"/></span> just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger.
I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly
rejoiced.”</p>
<p>He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part—in which
he was officially interested—of so great a tragedy was an object-lesson
in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.</p>
<p>He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort
to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock,
so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in
very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods,
and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits
at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>
quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity, and
exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings
as we could avoid were saved.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as
I felt he would like to be quite alone with her; but he took my arm and
led me in, saying <span class="join">huskily:—</span></p>
<p>“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how to
thank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think <span class="join">yet....”</span></p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 172]" id="pgepubid00184"><a id="Page_172" title="[Pg 172]"/></span></p>
<p>Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
laid his head on my breast, <span class="join">crying:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do? The whole of life seems gone from me
all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.”</p>
<p>I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s
heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said
softly to <span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“Come and look at her.”</p>
<p>Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint <span class="join">whisper:—</span></p>
<p>“Jack, is she really dead?”</p>
<p>I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest—for I felt
that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer
than I could help—that it often happened that after death faces became
softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the
coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in
his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.</p>
<p>I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s
men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When
he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and he
<span class="join">replied:—</span></p>
<p>“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”</p>
<p>We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
the best of things. Van Helsing had been<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 173]" id="pgepubid00185"><a id="Page_173" title="[Pg 173]"/></span> silent all dinner-time, but
when we had lit our cigars he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Lord——;” but Arthur interrupted <span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“No, no, not that, for God’s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:
I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
recent.”</p>
<p>The Professor answered very <span class="join">sweetly:—</span></p>
<p>“I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you—yes, my dear boy, to love you—as
Arthur.”</p>
<p>Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.</p>
<p>“Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope I may always have the title of
a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
your goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I know
that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was
rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so—you remember”—the
Professor nodded—“you must forgive me.”</p>
<p>He answered with a grave <span class="join">kindness:—</span></p>
<p>“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not—that you
cannot—trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot—and may
not—and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others, and for her
dear sake to whom I swore to protect.”</p>
<p>“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all ways
trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
Jack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”</p>
<p>The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
speak, and finally <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“May I ask you something now?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”</p>
<p>“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”</p>
<p>“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.
I want you to give me permission to read all Miss<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 174]" id="pgepubid00186"><a id="Page_174" title="[Pg 174]"/></span> Lucy’s papers and
letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
them—no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back
to you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
Lucy’s sake?”</p>
<p>Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old <span class="join">self:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I
am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you
with questions till the time comes.”</p>
<p>The old Professor stood up as he said <span class="join">solemnly:—</span></p>
<p>“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too—you most of
all, my dear boy—will have to pass through the bitter water before we
reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
duty, and all will be well!”</p>
<p>I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go
to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>22 September</em>.—In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.</p>
<p>It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
between them, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask
me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand—see what
unexpected prosperity does for us—so it may be as well to freshen it up
again with an exercise <span class="join">anyhow....</span></p>
<p>The service was very simple and very solemn. There were<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 175]" id="pgepubid00187"><a id="Page_175" title="[Pg 175]"/></span> only ourselves
and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter,
his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from <span class="join">us....</span></p>
<p>We came back to town quietly, taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner.
Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while,
so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’t go on
for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without
the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and
he was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us—and we didn’t
care if they did—so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
girl, in a big cartwheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Giuliano’s
when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
under his breath: “My God!” I am always anxious about Jonathan, for
I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him
quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.</p>
<p>He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and
black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,
and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was
hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.
Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I
feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked
Jonathan why he was so disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking
that I knew as much about it as he did: “Do you see who it is?”</p>
<p>“No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer seemed to
shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
to me, Mina, to whom he was <span class="join">speaking:—</span></p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 176]" id="pgepubid00188"><a id="Page_176" title="[Pg 176]"/></span></p>
<p>“It is the man himself!”</p>
<p>The poor dear was evidently terrified at something—very greatly
terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
support him, he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to <span class="join">himself:—</span></p>
<p>“I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this
be so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!” He was
distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
After a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyes closed, and
he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought
it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty
minutes he woke up, and said to me quite <span class="join">cheerfully:—</span></p>
<p>“Why, Mina, have I been asleep? Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had evidently forgotten
all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all
that this episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this lapsing into
forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must
not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow
learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I
must open that parcel and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,
I know, forgive me if I do wrong but it is for your own dear sake.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—A sad home-coming in every way—the house empty of the dear
soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
may <span class="join">be:—</span></p>
<p>“You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 177]" id="pgepubid00189"><a id="Page_177" title="[Pg 177]"/></span></p>
<p>Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to
have lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
troubles.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>22 September</em>.—It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as
any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If
America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the
world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to
his journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns
to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which
can only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he
says he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor
old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down
even his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could
see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over,
we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his
part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s
veins; I could see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns.
Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really
married, and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said
a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and
Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on
here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular
fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and
insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under
very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried and I had to draw
down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he
cried till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a
woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
manifestations of nervous strength or weakness!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 178]" id="pgepubid00190"><a id="Page_178" title="[Pg 178]"/></span> Then when his face grew
grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
forceful and mysterious. He <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just
the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door
and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is a king,
and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no time
of suitability. He say: ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example, I grieve my
heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
sufferers want that she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
grave—laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
coffin and say, ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood
from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy—that dear boy, so of
the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
father-heart yearn to him as to no other man—not even to you, friend
John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son—yet
even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my
ear, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring
some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend
John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and
woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance
to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard,
and tears that burn as they fall—all dance together to the music that
he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John,
that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes
drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come;
and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the
strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
our labour, what it may be.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 179]" id="pgepubid00191"><a id="Page_179" title="[Pg 179]"/></span></p>
<p>I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as
I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different <span class="join">tone:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, it was the grim irony of it all—this so lovely lady garlanded
with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered
if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that
lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the
mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going
‘Toll! toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
their eyes never on the page; and all us with the bowed head. And all
for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?”</p>
<p>“Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’t see anything to
laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.”</p>
<p>“Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
made her truly his bride?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”</p>
<p>“Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church’s law, though
no wits, all gone—even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
am bigamist.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I did
not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
his hand on my arm, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to him—for
he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time—maybe you would
perhaps pity me the most of all.”</p>
<p>I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 180]" id="pgepubid00192"><a id="Page_180" title="[Pg 180]"/></span></p>
<p>“Because I know!”</p>
<p>And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.</p>
<p>So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
another. If I do, or if I ever open this again, it will be to deal with
different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
life-work, I say sadly and without hope,</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
was known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or
“The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two
or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying
from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.
In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly
intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
is that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late
in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
children have not been found until early in the following morning. It
is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child
missed gave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had
asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and
used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite
game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles.
A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending
to be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our
caricaturists<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 181]" id="pgepubid00193"><a id="Page_181" title="[Pg 181]"/></span> might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing
the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular
rôle at these <i lang="it">al fresco</i> performances. Our correspondent naïvely
says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as
some of these grubby-faced little children pretend—and even imagine
themselves—to be.</p>
<p>There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some
of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might
be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children, especially
when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
which may be about.</p>

<p>We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at
the Shooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
story to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”</p>

<p><em>23 September</em>.—Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
and lock myself up in my room and read <span class="join">it....</span></p>
<p><em>24 September</em>.—I hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terrible
record of Jonathan’s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
terrible things; or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that
man we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow!
I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on
our wedding-day he said: “Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go
back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” There seems
to be through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count
was coming to London.... “If it should be, and he came to London, with
its teeming millions.” ... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come
we must not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 183]" id="pgepubid00196"><a id="Page_183" title="[Pg 183]"/></span>
typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready
for other eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am
ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never
let him be troubled or worried with it all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him
questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.</p>

<p>“Dear <span class="join">Madam,—</span></p>
<p>“I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I
send to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra’s death. By the kindness of
Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I
am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I
find some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and
how you love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me.
It is for others’ good that I ask—to redress great wrong, and to lift
much and terrible troubles—that may be more great than you can know.
May it be that I see you? You can trust me. I am a friend of Dr. John
Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep
it private for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you
at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I
implore your pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and
know how good you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if
it may be, enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and
forgive me.</p>

<p><em>25 September</em>.—I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect
it will throw some light upon Jonathan’s sad experience; and as he
attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
her. That is the reason for his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the
real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of
her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it;
and now he wants me to tell him about it, so that he may understand. I
hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should
never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one,
brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not
blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I
cannot bear more just at present.</p>
<p>I suppose a cry does us all good at times—clears the air as other rain
does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occur to upset him. It is two o’clock and the doctor will be here soon
now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unless he asks me. I am
so glad I have typewritten out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how
it all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it
be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s
journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor,
poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God all
this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 185]" id="pgepubid00198"><a id="Page_185" title="[Pg 185]"/></span> it
may be even a consolation and a help to him—terrible though it be and
awful in its consequences—to know for certain that his eyes and ears
and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that
it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no
matter which—waking or dreaming—may prove the truth, he will be more
satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be
a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr.
Seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a
noble nature. When he comes tomorrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’s
friend on “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in
such work—that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
interview; I shall try to record it <i lang="la">verbatim</i>.</p>
<p>It was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my courage
<i lang="fr">à deux mains</i> and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
announced “Dr. Van Helsing.”</p>
<p>I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium height,
strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy eyebrows come down and
the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first
almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide
apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble
over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes
are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s
moods. He said to <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.</p>
<p>“That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented.</p>
<p>“It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 186]" id="pgepubid00199"><a id="Page_186" title="[Pg 186]"/></span> that poor dear
child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.”</p>
<p>“Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you were
a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He took
it and said <span class="join">tenderly:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
good, but I had yet to learn——” He finished his speech with a courtly
bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
once <span class="join">began:—</span></p>
<p>“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary—you need not look
surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you left, and was made in
imitation of you—and in that diary she traces by inference certain
things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
kindness to tell me all of it that you remember.”</p>
<p>“I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then you have a good memory for facts, for details? It is not
always so with young ladies.”</p>
<p>“No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
if you like.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” I
could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit—I suppose it
is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
mouths—so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
bow, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“May I read it?”</p>
<p>“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
the instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.</p>
<p>“Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I long knew that Mr. Jonathan was
a man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for
me? Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was
over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
work-basket and handed it to him.</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 187]" id="pgepubid00200"><a id="Page_187" title="[Pg 187]"/></span> been thinking
that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might
not have to wait—not on my account, but because I know your time must
be precious—I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”</p>
<p>He took it, and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may
I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”</p>
<p>“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
can ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself in a
chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
whilst I went to see after lunch, chiefly in order that he might not be
disturbed. When I came back I found him walking hurriedly up and down
the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
took me by both hands.</p>
<p>“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
much light; and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
clever woman. Madam”—he said this very solemnly—“if ever Abraham Van
Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
your husband will be blessed in you.”</p>
<p>“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and—and you do not know me.”</p>
<p>“Not know you—I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
women; I, who have made my speciality the brain and all that belongs
to him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that
you have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in
every line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
angels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
you<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 188]" id="pgepubid00201"><a id="Page_188" title="[Pg 188]"/></span> trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
husband—tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone,
and is he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about
Jonathan, so I <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“He has almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’s
death.” He <span class="join">interrupted:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I
went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
had a sort of shock.”</p>
<p>“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
shock was it?”</p>
<p>“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
which led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed to
overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite <span class="join">sweetness:—</span></p>
<p>“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here
by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
nobility that I feel more than ever—and it has grown with my advancing
years—the loneliness of my life. Believe me, then, that I come here
full of respect for you, and you have given me hope—hope, not in what
I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
happy—good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do <em>all</em> for him
that I can—all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like
not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 189]" id="pgepubid00202"><a id="Page_189" title="[Pg 189]"/></span> you must
eat and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I
want to think over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will
ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of husband
Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat now;
afterwards you shall tell me all.”</p>
<p>After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this great,
learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
Jonathan a madman—that journal is all so strange—and I hesitated to
go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
trusted him, so I <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
have even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me by
his manner as well as his words when he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, my dear, if you only knew how strange is the matter regarding which
I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
of any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off
my mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is
long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
Jonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
me what you think.”</p>
<p>“I promise,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the morning,
so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.”</p>
<p>“Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
with us and see him then; you could catch<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 190]" id="pgepubid00203"><a id="Page_190" title="[Pg 190]"/></span> the quick 3.34 train, which
will leave you at Paddington before eight.” He was surprised at my
knowledge of the trains offhand, but he does not know that I have made
up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
case he is in a hurry.</p>
<p>So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
thinking—thinking I don’t know what.</p>

<p>“I have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without

no dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of

swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to

<p><em>26 September</em>.—I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her having
given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she had been
about me. She showed me in the doctor’s letter that all I wrote down was
true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I <em>know</em>, I am not afraid, even
of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him <span class="join">over....</span></p>
<p>He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where
he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder and turned my
face round to the light, and said, after a sharp <span class="join">scrutiny:—</span></p>
<p>“But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.” It
was so funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by this kindly,
strong-faced old man. I smiled, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“I <em>was</em> ill, I <em>have</em> had a shock; but you have cured me already.”</p>
<p>“And how?”</p>
<p>“By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
evidence of my own senses. Not<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 192]" id="pgepubid00205"><a id="Page_192" title="[Pg 192]"/></span> knowing what to trust, I did not know
what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
myself. Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even
yourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” He
seemed pleased, and laughed as he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” I
would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
and stood silent.</p>
<p>“She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men
and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
egoist—and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
selfish. And you, sir—I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
lives.”</p>
<p>We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
choky.</p>
<p>“And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.”</p>
<p>“Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the Count?”</p>
<p>“It does,” he said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10.30 train, you
will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
You can take them with you and read them in the train.”</p>
<p>After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said:</p>
<p>“Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
too.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 193]" id="pgepubid00206"><a id="Page_193" title="[Pg 193]"/></span></p>
<p>“We shall both come when you will,” I said.</p>
<p>I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for
the train to start, he was turning them over. His eye suddenly seemed
to catch something in one of them, “The Westminster Gazette”—I knew
it by the colour—and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
groaning to himself: “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!” I do not
think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
the window and waved his hand, calling out: “Love to Madam Mina; I shall
write so soon as ever I can.”</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>26 September</em>.—Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
since I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he
had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any
trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from
it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is
with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well
of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows too,
but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to
Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and
almost bounded into my room at about half-past five o’clock, and thrust
last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 194]" id="pgepubid00207"><a id="Page_194" title="[Pg 194]"/></span></p>
<p>“What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded his
arms.</p>
<p>I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but
he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being
decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached
a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
idea struck me, and I looked up. “Well?” he said.</p>
<p>“It is like poor Lucy’s.”</p>
<p>“And what do make of it?”</p>
<p>“Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
her has injured them.” I did not quite understand his <span class="join">answer:—</span></p>
<p>“That is true indirectly, but not directly.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a little inclined to take
his seriousness lightly—for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits—but
when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.</p>
<p>“Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as
to what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
events, but by me?”</p>
<p>“Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”</p>
<p>“And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped over and
sat down beside me, and went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s
eyes, because they know—or think they know—some things which other
men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
explain. But yet we see<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 195]" id="pgepubid00208"><a id="Page_195" title="[Pg 195]"/></span> around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
to be young—like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do
not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No?
Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
<span class="join">hypnotism——”</span></p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as
he went on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course
then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
Charcot—alas that he is no more!—into the very soul of the patient
that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
be a blank? No? Then tell me—for I am student of the brain—how you
accept the hypnotism and reject the thought-reading. Let me tell you,
my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science
which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
electricity—who would themselves not so long before have been burned as
wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah
lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and sixty-nine,
and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor veins, could
not live even one day? For, had she lived one more day, we could have
save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know the
altogether of comparative anatomy, and can say wherefore the qualities
of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why,
when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for
centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
on the trees all day, that those who have seen describe as like giant
nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
it is hot, flit down on them, and then—and then in the morning are
found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”</p>
<p>“Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do you mean to tell me that
Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 196]" id="pgepubid00209"><a id="Page_196" title="[Pg 196]"/></span> a thing is here in London
in the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence, and went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
women who cannot die? We all know—because science has vouched for the
fact—that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and
the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then
men come and take away the unbroken seal, and that there lie the Indian
fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” Here
I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
his list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that
my imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching
me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam;
but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object
of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without his help, yet I
wanted to follow him, so I <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
idea. I feel like a novice blundering through a bog in a mist, jumping
from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
knowing where I am going.”</p>
<p>“That is good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
this: I want you to believe.”</p>
<p>“To believe what?”</p>
<p>“To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
of an American who so defined faith: ‘that which enables us to believe
things which we know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man. He meant
that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check
the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 197]" id="pgepubid00210"><a id="Page_197" title="[Pg 197]"/></span> rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get
the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him; but all the
same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.”</p>
<p>“Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
your lesson aright?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children’s
throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.” He stood up and said <span class="join">solemnly:—</span></p>
<p>“Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
far, far worse.”</p>
<p>“In God’s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?” I cried.</p>
<p>He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he <span class="join">spoke:—</span></p>
<p>“They were made by Miss Lucy!”</p>

<p>For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
<span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me, and
somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I were!” he
said. “Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
fearful death? Ah no!”</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” said I. He went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to
you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do
not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
it. Dare you come with me?”</p>
<p>This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
excepted from the category, jealousy.</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza s6 bottom1">
<div class="verse">“And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>He saw my hesitation, and <span class="join">spoke:—</span></p>
<p>“The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock
to tussock in a misty fog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
at worst it will not harm. If it be true!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 199]" id="pgepubid00213"><a id="Page_199" title="[Pg 199]"/></span> Ah, there is the dread; yet
very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
in the hospital. Dr. Vincent of the North Hospital, where the papers say
the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in
class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will
not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to
learn. And <span class="join">then——”</span></p>
<p>“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then we
spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This
is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give
to Arthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there were some
fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up
what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon
was <span class="join">passing....</span></p>
<p>We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food,
and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from
its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
similarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller,
and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what
he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of
some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to
think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may
be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
the Zoological Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days
ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction.
For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood
on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’
scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them.
Even this poor little mite, when he woke up today, asked the nurse if he
might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”</p>
<p>“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 200]" id="pgepubid00214"><a id="Page_200" title="[Pg 200]"/></span> the child home
you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
not let it away for some days?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
healed.”</p>
<p>Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
was, he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”</p>
<p>We dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of
bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we
started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for
he went on unhesitatingly; but as for me, I was in quite a mix-up
as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people,
till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol
of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached
the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little
difficulty—for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange
to us—we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened
the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously,
motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer,
in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring
one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
fumbled in his bag, and taking out a match-box and a piece of candle,
proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the daytime, and when wreathed
with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now some
days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
stone, and dust-encrusted<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 201]" id="pgepubid00215"><a id="Page_201" title="[Pg 201]"/></span> mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life—animal life—was
not the only thing which could pass away.</p>
<p>Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
made assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
out a turnscrew.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?” I asked.</p>
<p>“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began
taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again
fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point
of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side
of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking
the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
look.</p>
<p>I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.</p>
<p>It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied now, friend
John?” he asked.</p>
<p>I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
I answered him:</p>
<p>“I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only
proves one thing.”</p>
<p>“And what is that, friend John?”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 202]" id="pgepubid00216"><a id="Page_202" title="[Pg 202]"/></span></p>
<p>“That it is not there.”</p>
<p>“That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you—how
can you—account for it not being there?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s people
may have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ah
well!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”</p>
<p>He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
locked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You had
better be assured.” I laughed—it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
bound to say—as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said;
“there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
of that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he could watch
at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
sight.</p>
<p>It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust; so altogether I had
a dreary, miserable time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
Professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then
I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs,
and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far
off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
rustle of actual<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 203]" id="pgepubid00217"><a id="Page_203" title="[Pg 203]"/></span> movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
he saw me he held it out to me, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Are you satisfied now?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.</p>
<p>“Do you not see the child?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.</p>
<p>When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It was
without a scratch or scar of any kind.</p>
<p>“Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.</p>
<p>“We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.</p>
<p>We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to
give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavy tramp,
and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw
it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of
astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
cab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.</p>
<p>I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours’
sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
go with him on another expedition.</p>
<p><em>27 September</em>.—It was two o’clock before we found a suitable
opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we
saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe
till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should
not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 204]" id="pgepubid00218"><a id="Page_204" title="[Pg 204]"/></span> sense
of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed
out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which
we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all
so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a
woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of
folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and
again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome
as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed.
He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
of surprise and dismay shot through me.</p>
<p>There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.</p>
<p>“Is this a juggle?” I said to him.</p>
<p>“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
dead lips and showed the white teeth.</p>
<p>“See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With this
and this”—and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
it—“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
John?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I <em>could</em> not
accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“She may have been placed here since last night.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”</p>
<p>“I do not know. Some one has done it.”</p>
<p>“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 205]" id="pgepubid00219"><a id="Page_205" title="[Pg 205]"/></span> eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded: here is
some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
when she was in a trance, sleep-walking—oh, you start; you do not know
that, friend John, but you shall know it all later—and in trance could
he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
the Un-Dead sleep at home”—as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
his arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”—“their face show what
they are, but this so sweet that-was when she not Un-Dead she go back to
the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood
cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s
theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
my face, for he said almost <span class="join">joyously:—</span></p>
<p>“Ah, you believe now?”</p>
<p>I answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
accept. How will you do this bloody work?”</p>
<p>“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
drive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so
mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
or all objective?</p>
<p>I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
snap, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If
I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what
is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that
are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
now would<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 206]" id="pgepubid00220"><a id="Page_206" title="[Pg 206]"/></span> be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have
to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s
at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
beautiful in a whole week after she die—if you know of this and know of
the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when
I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always.
Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and, again, he
will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and
see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the
Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later
we shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.”</p>
<p>So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 207]" id="pgepubid00221"><a id="Page_207" title="[Pg 207]"/></span></p>

to John Seward, M.D</em>.</p>
<p class="center">(Not delivered.)</p>
<p class="rght5">“<em>27 September</em>.</p>
<p>“Friend <span class="join">John,—</span></p>
<p>“I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall
not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more
eager. Therefore I shall fix some things she like not—garlic and a
crucifix—and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out;
they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
Lucy, or from her, I have no fear: but that other to whom is there that
she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life, and
we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the
strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf
and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he
shall find me; but none other shall—until it be too late. But it may be
that he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should;
his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
Un-Dead woman sleep, and one old man watch.</p>
<p>“Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
though it, so that the world may rest from him.</p>
<p>“If it be so, farewell.</p>

<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>28 September</em>.—It is wonderful what a good night’s sleep will do for
one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing’s monstrous
ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be <em>some</em>
rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some
light on the mystery.</p>
<p><em>29 September, morning</em>.... Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,
Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room; he told us all what he
wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
all come with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave duty to be
done there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?” This query was
directly addressed to Lord Godalming.</p>
<p>“I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
that I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.”</p>
<p>“Me, too,” said Quincey Morris laconically.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of
you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
even get so far as to begin.”</p>
<p>It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
with intense <span class="join">gravity:—</span></p>
<p>“I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
in the dark,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 209]" id="pgepubid00223"><a id="Page_209" title="[Pg 209]"/></span> so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for
a time—I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
be—you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”</p>
<p>“That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answer for the Professor.
I don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and that’s good
enough for me.”</p>
<p>“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I have done myself the
honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
to me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey took.</p>
<p>Then Arthur spoke <span class="join">out:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quite like to ‘buy a pig in a poke,’ as they
say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
these two, then I give my consent at once; though, for the life of me, I
cannot understand what you are driving at.”</p>
<p>“I accept your limitation,” said Van Helsing, “and all I ask of you
is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will
first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
reservations.”</p>
<p>“Agreed!” said Arthur; “that is only fair. And now that the
<em>pourparlers</em> are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?”</p>
<p>“I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
Kingstead.”</p>
<p>Arthur’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of <span class="join">way:—</span></p>
<p>“Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: “And
when there?”</p>
<p>“To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up.</p>
<p>“Professor, are you in earnest; or is it some monstrous joke? Pardon
me, I see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see
that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
silence until he asked <span class="join">again:—</span></p>
<p>“And when in the tomb?”</p>
<p>“To open the coffin.”</p>
<p>“This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to be
patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this—this desecration
of the grave—of one who——” He<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 210]" id="pgepubid00224"><a id="Page_210" title="[Pg 210]"/></span> fairly choked with indignation. The
Professor looked pityingly at him.</p>
<p>“If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “God knows I
would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”</p>
<p>Arthur looked up with set, white face and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Take care, sir, take care!”</p>
<p>“Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?” said Van Helsing.
“And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go on?”</p>
<p>“That’s fair enough,” broke in Morris.</p>
<p>After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an <span class="join">effort:—</span></p>
<p>“Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
her. But if she be not <span class="join">dead——”</span></p>
<p>Arthur jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>“Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
she been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
soften.</p>
<p>“I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”</p>
<p>“Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
is it?”</p>
<p>“There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?”</p>
<p>“Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not for
the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things,
or am I mad that listen to them? Don’t dare to think more of such a
desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
it!”</p>
<p>Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
said, gravely and <span class="join">sternly:—</span></p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 211]" id="pgepubid00225"><a id="Page_211" title="[Pg 211]"/></span></p>
<p>“My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a
duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask
you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if
when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
fulfilment even than I am, then—then I shall do my duty, whatever it
may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes, I shall
hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
you will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with an accent full
of <span class="join">pity:—</span></p>
<p>“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you
will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to
save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much
of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to
do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then
to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her—I am
ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness—I gave what you gave:
the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover,
but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and
days—before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even
now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” He said
this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it.
He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken <span class="join">voice:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
will go with you and wait.”</p>

<p>It was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the
churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark, with occasional
gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded
across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing
slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb
I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place
laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself
well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding tended in some
way a counteractent to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and
seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the
difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he
closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin.
Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
coffin?”</p>
<p>“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest, <span class="join">saying:—</span></p>
<p>“You hear; and yet there is one who does not believe with me.” He
took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
recoiled.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 213]" id="pgepubid00228"><a id="Page_213" title="[Pg 213]"/></span></p>
<p>The coffin was empty!</p>
<p>For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
Quincey <span class="join">Morris:—</span></p>
<p>“Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t
ask such a thing ordinarily—I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a
doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
Is this your doing?”</p>
<p>“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
I came here—with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
daytime, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here
all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away
my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
So”—here he shut the dark slide of his lantern—“now to the outside.”
He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
door behind him.</p>
<p>Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror
of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the
brief gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
passing—like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it
was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay;
how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and
to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city.
Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and
was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 214]" id="pgepubid00229"><a id="Page_214" title="[Pg 214]"/></span> the inner meaning
of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again
to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey
Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has
to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug
of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
also, as they too were curious. He <span class="join">answered:—</span></p>
<p>“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”</p>
<p>“And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey.
“Great Scott! Is this a game?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by
Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he <span class="join">answered:—</span></p>
<p>“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was an
answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a
purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it
was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet
I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress,
or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did
tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
woeful presage through the night.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 215]" id="pgepubid00230"><a id="Page_215" title="[Pg 215]"/></span></p>
<p>There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from
the Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue
of yews we saw a white figure advance—a dim white figure, which held
something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a
ray of moonlight fell between the masses of driving clouds and showed in
startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of
the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we
saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry,
such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and
dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen
by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked
the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to
see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as
ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features
of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of
the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
concentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lips
were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.</p>
<p>We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.</p>
<p>When Lucy—I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
shape—saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form
and colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
how it<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 216]" id="pgepubid00231"><a id="Page_216" title="[Pg 216]"/></span> made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung
to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile, he fell
back and hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
<span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!”</p>
<p>There was something diabolically sweet in her tones—something of the
tingling of glass when struck—which rang through the brains even of us
who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
the tomb.</p>
<p>When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped as if
arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now
no quiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again
by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to
throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the
folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,
blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death—if looks could
kill—we saw it at that moment.</p>
<p>And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking <span class="join">Arthur:—</span></p>
<p>“Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 217]" id="pgepubid00232"><a id="Page_217" title="[Pg 217]"/></span></p>
<p>Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
<span class="join">answered:—</span></p>
<p>“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror
like this ever any more!” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear
the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming
close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the
sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
body as real at the moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
to the edges of the door.</p>
<p>When this was done, he lifted the child and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow
night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
him, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming close to Arthur,
he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“My friend Arthur, you have had sore trial; but after, when you will
look back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the
bitter waters, my child. By this time tomorrow, you will, please God,
have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.”</p>
<p>Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
slept with more or less reality of sleep.</p>
<p><em>29 September, night</em>.—A little before twelve o’clock we three—Arthur,
Quincey Morris, and myself—called for the Professor. It was odd to
notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 218]" id="pgepubid00233"><a id="Page_218" title="[Pg 218]"/></span>
strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
gravediggers had completed their task, and the sexton, under the belief
that everyone had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
fair weight.</p>
<p>When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing
it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and
also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their
own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient
to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all
looked—Arthur trembling like an aspen—and saw that the body lay there
in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing
but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without her
soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presently
he said to Van <span class="join">Helsing:—</span></p>
<p>“Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”</p>
<p>“It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you shall see her
as she was, and is.”</p>
<p>She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed
teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth—which it made one shudder
to see—the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like
a devilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, in his
methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame;
then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round
wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three
feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was
sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To
me, a doctor’s preparations for work<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 219]" id="pgepubid00234"><a id="Page_219" title="[Pg 219]"/></span> of any kind are stimulating and
bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
courage, and remained silent and quiet.</p>
<p>When all was ready, Van Helsing <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
die from the preying of the Un-Dead become themselves Un-Dead, and prey
on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had
met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last
night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had
died, have become <em>nosferatu</em>, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and
would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with
horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.
Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse;
but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood, and
by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood
with that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the
tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
night and growing more debased in the assimilation of it by day, she
shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
night when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose’? Tell me if there be
such a one amongst us.”</p>
<p>We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 220]" id="pgepubid00235"><a id="Page_220" title="[Pg 220]"/></span> the infinite
kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
<span class="join">snow:—</span></p>
<p>“My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
what I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on his
shoulder, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must be
driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal—be not deceived in
that—but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
you all the time.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”</p>
<p>“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
the dead—I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
follow—strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that
we love, and that the Un-Dead pass away.”</p>
<p>Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.</p>
<p>The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
lips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
gave us courage, so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
vault.</p>
<p>And then the writhing and quivering of the body became<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 221]" id="pgepubid00236"><a id="Page_221" title="[Pg 221]"/></span> less, and the
teeth ceased to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
terrible task was over.</p>
<p>The hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
we not caught him. Great drops of sweat sprang out on his forehead, and
his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
horror that lay upon it.</p>
<p>There in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
there was there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.</p>
<p>Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said to
<span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“And now, Arthur, my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”</p>
<p>The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s hand
in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and laying
his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to <span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
devil now—not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
the devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul is with Him!”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 222]" id="pgepubid00237"><a id="Page_222" title="[Pg 222]"/></span></p>
<p>Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and
gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked the
door he gave the key to Arthur.</p>
<p>Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.</p>
<p>Before we moved away Van Helsing <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
of us—is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”</p>
<p>Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
Professor as we moved <span class="join">off:—</span></p>
<p>“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first
I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to
dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is
a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare, we
must not draw back.”</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
waiting for <span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.—M<span class="smaller">INA</span>
H<span class="smaller">ARKER</span>.”</p>
<p>The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,” he said,
“pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her <i lang="fr">en
route</i>, so that she may be prepared.”</p>
<p>When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” he
said, “and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all
your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day.
What is here told,” he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet
of papers as he spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and me
and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk
the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can
add in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important.
You have kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes!
Then we shall go through all these together when that we meet.” He then
made ready for his departure, and shortly after<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 224]" id="pgepubid00240"><a id="Page_224" title="[Pg 224]"/></span> drove off to Liverpool
Street. I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen
minutes before the train came in.</p>
<p>The crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrival
platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
after a quick glance, said: “Dr. Seward, is it not?”</p>
<p>“And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she held out
her hand.</p>
<p>“I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but——” She stopped
suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.</p>
<p>The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for
it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I
had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.</p>
<p>In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a slight
shudder when we entered.</p>
<p>She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking
at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open
before me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
she is!</p>

<p><em>29 September</em>.—After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward’s
study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
the door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered.</p>
<p>To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
and on the table opposite him was what I knew<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 225]" id="pgepubid00241"><a id="Page_225" title="[Pg 225]"/></span> at once from the
description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
interested.</p>
<p>“I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the door
as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” he replied, with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”</p>
<p>“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand on
the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted <span class="join">out:—</span></p>
<p>“Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.</p>
<p>“The fact is,” he began awkwardly, “I only keep my diary in it; and as
it is entirely—almost entirely—about my cases, it may be awkward—that
is, I mean——” He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
<span class="join">embarrassment:—</span></p>
<p>“You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
for all that I can know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very,
very dear to me.”</p>
<p>To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his <span class="join">face:—</span></p>
<p>“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”</p>
<p>“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
At length he stammered <span class="join">out:—</span></p>
<p>“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he
said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the
naïveté of a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!”
I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself away that
time!” he said. “But do you know that, although I have kept the diary
for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any
particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my
mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
something to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 226]" id="pgepubid00242"><a id="Page_226" title="[Pg 226]"/></span> add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being,
and I said <span class="join">boldly:—</span></p>
<p>“Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
typewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn’t let you know that terrible
story!”</p>
<p>Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
some opportunity to aid me, they lit on the great batch of typewriting
on the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his
thinking, followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised
my meaning.</p>
<p>“You do not know me,” I said. “When you have read those papers—my
own diary and my husband’s also, which I have typed—you will know me
better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
this cause; but, of course, you do not know me—yet; and I must not
expect you to trust me so far.”</p>
<p>He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
<span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them—the
first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
able to understand certain things.” He carried the phonograph himself up
to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
episode of which I know one side <span class="join">already....</span></p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>29 September</em>.—I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 227]" id="pgepubid00243"><a id="Page_227" title="[Pg 227]"/></span> of Jonathan
Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
dinner, so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour;”
and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker’s diary,
when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes
were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I <span class="join">could:—</span></p>
<p>“I greatly fear I have distressed you.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but I have been more touched
than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
It was like a soul crying out to almighty God. No one must hear them
spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
I did.”</p>
<p>“No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. She
laid her hand on mine and said very <span class="join">gravely:—</span></p>
<p>“Ah, but they must!”</p>
<p>“Must! But why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy’s
death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the
knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders
which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I
can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery.
You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point,
and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how
poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out.
Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
if some of us were in the dark.” She looked at me so appealingly, and at
the same time manifested such<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 228]" id="pgepubid00244"><a id="Page_228" title="[Pg 228]"/></span> courage and resolution in her bearing,
that I gave in at once to her wishes. “You shall,” I said, “do as you
like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
poor Lucy’s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
dark. Nay, the end—the very end—may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
the rest, and I will answer any questions you ask—if there be anything
which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
present.”</p>

<p><em>29 September</em>.—After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
put the forked metal to my ears and listened.</p>
<p>When the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and—and all that followed,
was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of
a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if
I had not known Jonathan’s experience in Transylvania I could not have
believed. As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of
my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
typewriter, and said to Dr. <span class="join">Seward:—</span></p>
<p>“Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
he arrives in London from<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 229]" id="pgepubid00245"><a id="Page_229" title="[Pg 229]"/></span> Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell
them when they come.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace,
and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder.
I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had
done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward
went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had
finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel
too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world
seems full of good men—even if there <em>are</em> monsters in it. Before I
left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor’s
perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station
at Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed
the files of “The Westminster Gazette” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and
took them to my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The
Whitby Gazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand
the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p><em>30 September</em>.—Mr. Harker arrived at nine o’clock. He had got his
wife’s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
judge from his face, and full of energy. If his journal be true—and
judging by one’s own wonderful experiences it must be—he is also a
man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was
a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
business-like gentleman who came here to-day.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
chronological order every scrap<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 230]" id="pgepubid00246"><a id="Page_230" title="[Pg 230]"/></span> of evidence they have. Harker has
got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife’s
typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here he <span class="join">is....</span></p>
<p>Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the
Count’s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the
conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the
purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had
them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that way madness lies!
Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He says that
by dinner-time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative. He
thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has
been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see
this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good
thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
found the dates <span class="join">otherwise....</span></p>
<p>I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded,
smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw.
I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he
treated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a
subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here.
In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once. I
believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters
and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for
him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious.
All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that his
instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph? Stay; he
is himself zoophagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door
of the deserted house he always spoke of “master.” This all seems
confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came away; my friend
is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too
deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then—! So I came
away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so I have given the attendant
a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready
in case of need.</p>

<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Jonathan Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>29 September, in train to London</em>.—When I received Mr. Billington’s
courteous message that he would give me any information in his power,
I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
of the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
brought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I must
stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington
had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of
boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which
I had seen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle
which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being
carried out. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the
absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply
the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
“Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.”
Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
officers, and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the
strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
tradition; but no one could add to the simple description: “Fifty cases
of common earth.” I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in
communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
the boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was
dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t
any gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of
appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
that the thirst then<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 232]" id="pgepubid00248"><a id="Page_232" title="[Pg 232]"/></span> generated was such that even the time which had
elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.</p>
<p><em>30 September</em>.—The station-master was good enough to give me a line
to his old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when
I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival
of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
compelled to deal with the result in an <i lang="la">ex post facto</i> manner.</p>
<p>From thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I
met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross
office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the
written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying at a
later period this beneficent evil, one of the men <span class="join">remarked:—</span></p>
<p>“That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but
it ain’t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick
in the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer
bones; an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole
Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel—that took the cike, that did! Me
and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. Lor’, I
wouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.”</p>
<p>Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.</p>
<p>Of one thing I am now satisfied: that <em>all</em> the boxes which<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 233]" id="pgepubid00249"><a id="Page_233" title="[Pg 233]"/></span> arrived
at Whitby from Varna in the <em>Demeter</em> were safely deposited in the old
chapel of Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
since been removed—as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.</p>
<p>I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
deal.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
into order.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>30 September</em>.—I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave
a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear,
good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night.
I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity
any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is
not human—not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s
death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
one’s heart.</p>
<p><em>Later</em>.—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan
with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for
it brought back all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago.
Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr.
Van Helsing, too, had been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris
expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over,
and came to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 234]" id="pgepubid00250"><a id="Page_234" title="[Pg 234]"/></span> the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to
post them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary
that they had been at Lucy’s death—her real death—and that I need not
fear to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
his and turned it over—it does make a pretty good pile—he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”</p>
<p>I nodded, and he went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that
all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I
have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man
humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor
Lucy——” Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands.
I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive
delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked
quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature
that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings
on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his
manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down
on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and
took his hand. I hope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he
ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I
wrong him; I <em>know</em> he never will—he is too true a gentleman. I said to
him, for I could see that his heart was <span class="join">breaking:—</span></p>
<p>“I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
help in your affliction, won’t you let me be of some little service—for
Lucy’s sake?”</p>
<p>In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
to me that all that he had of late been suffering<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 235]" id="pgepubid00251"><a id="Page_235" title="[Pg 235]"/></span> in silence found a
vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
head on my shoulder, and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook
with emotion.</p>
<p>We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big,
sorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.</p>
<p>After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that
for days and nights past—weary days and sleepless nights—he had
been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
whom, owing to the terrible circumstances with which his sorrow was
surrounded, he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said,
as he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet—and none other can
ever know—how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
like a brother, will you not, for all our lives—for dear Lucy’s sake?”</p>
<p>“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for your
own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth
the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring
to you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will not call
in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
will let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
I felt it would comfort him, so I <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 236]" id="pgepubid00252"><a id="Page_236" title="[Pg 236]"/></span> of a window.
He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then noticing
my red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”</p>
<p>He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
how much I knew; so I said to <span class="join">him:—</span></p>
<p>“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
will know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and
stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
momentary choking in his throat; he said quite <span class="join">calmly:—</span></p>
<p>“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
as ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.</p>
<p>“Little girl!”—the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
proved himself a friend!</p>

<p><em>30 September</em>.—I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming
and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to
the carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker
gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time
since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like <em>home</em>. When we had
finished, Mrs. Harker <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”</p>
<p>“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I
answered. “Oh, very well,” he said: “let her come in, by all means; but
just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was
peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
task, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on the
edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 238]" id="pgepubid00255"><a id="Page_238" title="[Pg 238]"/></span>
before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where
I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
the respect of any lunatic—for easiness is one of the qualities mad
people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
held out her hand.</p>
<p>“Good evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr.
Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
<span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,
you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she <span class="join">replied:—</span></p>
<p>“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”</p>
<p>“Then what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”</p>
<p>“Then don’t stay.”</p>
<p>“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be
pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined <span class="join">in:—</span></p>
<p>“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply
contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
Harker to me, instantly turning them back <span class="join">again:—</span></p>
<p>“What an asinine question!”</p>
<p>“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once
championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
he had shown contempt to <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is loved
and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in
our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and
his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly
in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I
myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 239]" id="pgepubid00256"><a id="Page_239" title="[Pg 239]"/></span> cannot but notice
that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the
errors of <i lang="la">non causa</i> and <em>ignoratio elenchi</em>.” I positively opened my
eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic—the most
pronounced of his type that I had ever met with—talking elemental
philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it
was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched some chord in his memory.
If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious
influence, she must have some rare gift or power.</p>
<p>We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished,
for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
certain things.</p>
<p>“Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my
being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion
I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers
by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of
his blood—relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the
blood is the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true,
doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what I
ought to think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat
up his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch,
I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told
Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,
under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he
<span class="join">replied:—</span></p>
<p>“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
May He bless and keep you!”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 240]" id="pgepubid00257"><a id="Page_240" title="[Pg 240]"/></span></p>
<p>When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
many a long day.</p>
<p>Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, <span class="join">saying:—</span></p>
<p>“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”</p>
<p>As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion; at
which the Professor interrupted <span class="join">me:—</span></p>
<p>“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain—a brain that a
man should have were he much gifted—and woman’s heart. The good God
fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
determined—nay, are we not pledged?—to destroy this monster; but it is
no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer—both in
waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things
to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then
she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work,
and we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what
we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
to come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then we
might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk
that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not think
of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence that
lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
dinner he said to Mrs. <span class="join">Harker:—</span></p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 241]" id="pgepubid00258"><a id="Page_241" title="[Pg 241]"/></span></p>
<p>“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”</p>
<p>“Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to
this morning.”</p>
<p>“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
has told is the worse for it.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pocket, she
<span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in? It
is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely,
and handed it back, <span class="join">saying:—</span></p>
<p>“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but pray that it may. It can
but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
honour you—as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back with
another blush and a bright smile.</p>
<p>And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of us
have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
terrible and mysterious enemy.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Mina Harker’s Journal</em>.</p>
<p><em>30 September</em>.—When we met in Dr. Seward’s study two hours after
dinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table,
to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me
sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan
sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
Morris—Lord Godalming being next to the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
centre. The Professor <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 242]" id="pgepubid00259"><a id="Page_242" title="[Pg 242]"/></span></p>
<p>“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
that are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind
of enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for
me. So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
according.</p>
<p>“There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that
they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience,
the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
through long years I have trained myself to keep an open mind, I could
not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See!
see! I prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I
know—nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious life had been spared
to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work,
that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The <em>nosferatu</em>
do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and
being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which
is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is
of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he
have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply,
the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to
are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil
in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations,
appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to
him; he can, within his range, direct the elements: the storm, the fog,
the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the
owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and
become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are
we to begin our strife to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and
having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a
terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make
the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win;
and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 243]" id="pgepubid00260"><a id="Page_243" title="[Pg 243]"/></span> not. But to fail
here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we
henceforward become foul things of the night like him—without heart or
conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best.
To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to
us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of
God’s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are
face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say,
no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
song of birds, his music, and his love, lie far behind. You others are
young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
say you?”</p>
<p>Whilst he was speaking Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch—so
strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak for
itself; it does not even need a woman’s love to hear its music.</p>
<p>When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
in his; there was no need for speaking between us.</p>
<p>“I answer for Mina and myself,” he said.</p>
<p>“Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.</p>
<p>“I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’s sake, if for no other
reason.”</p>
<p>Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up, and, after laying his
golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
as any other transaction of <span class="join">life:—</span></p>
<p>“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
without strength. We have on our side power of combination—a power
denied to the vampire kind; we<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 244]" id="pgepubid00261"><a id="Page_244" title="[Pg 244]"/></span> have resources of science; we are free
to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours
equally. In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and
we are free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.</p>
<p>“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.</p>
<p>“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do
not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and
death—nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied;
in the first place because we have to be—no other means is at our
control—and secondly, because, after all, these things—tradition and
superstition—are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest
for others—though not, alas! for us—on them? A year ago which of us
would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
all over, in France, in India, even in the Chersonese; and in China,
so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him
at this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then,
we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of
the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of
the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of
the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan
observe. He has the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 245]" id="pgepubid00262"><a id="Page_245" title="[Pg 245]"/></span> strength of many in his hand—witness again
Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create—that noble
ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
come on moonlight rays as elemental dust—as again Jonathan saw those
sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small—we ourselves saw
Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hair-breadth space at
the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything
or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up
with fire—solder you call it. He can see in the dark—no small power
this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear
me through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is
even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his
cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to
obey some of nature’s laws—why we know not. He may not enter anywhere
at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to
come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as
does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain
times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither
he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise
or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we
have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his
limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the
place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
them he is nothing,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 246]"><a id="Page_246" title="[Pg 246]"/></span> but in their presence he take his place far off and
silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
We have seen it with our eyes.</p>
<p>“Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what
he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won
his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the
most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond
the forest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him
to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were,
says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions
who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One.
They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains
over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his
due. In the records are such words as ‘stregoica’—witch, ‘ordog,’ and
‘pokol’—Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have been
from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”</p>
<p>Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
pause, and then the Professor went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
that from the castle<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 247]" id="pgepubid00263"><a id="Page_247" title="[Pg 247]"/></span> to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these
boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be
to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
latter, we must <span class="join">trace——”</span></p>
<p>Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with
a bullet, which, ricocheting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris’s voice
<span class="join">without:—</span></p>
<p>“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
it.” A minute later he came in and <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly.
But the fact is that while the Professor was talking there came a big
bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings whenever I have
seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”</p>
<p>“Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.</p>
<p>“I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Without
saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
<span class="join">statement:—</span></p>
<p>“We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.</p>
<p>“And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night,
you no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are
men, and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
are.”</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 248]" id="pgepubid00264"><a id="Page_248" title="[Pg 248]"/></span></p>
<p>All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to
me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
safety—strength being the best safety—through care of me; but their
minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.</p>
<p>Mr. Morris resumed the <span class="join">discussion:—</span></p>
<p>“As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
another victim.”</p>
<p>I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
with means to get into the house.</p>
<p>Manlike, they have told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.</p>
<p class="s4 center top2 bottom1"><em>Dr. Seward’s Diary</em></p>
<p><em>1 October, 4 a.m.</em>—Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent
message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at
once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me. I told
the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning; I
was busy just at the moment. The attendant <span class="join">added:—</span></p>
<p>“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I
don’t know but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of his
violent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without some
cause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now;” and I asked the others to
wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”</p>
<p>“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in your
diary interested me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on
<em>our</em> case. I should much like to see him, and especially when his mind
is disturbed.”</p>
<p>“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 249]" id="pgepubid00265"><a id="Page_249" title="[Pg 249]"/></span></p>
<p>“Me too?” said Quincey Morris. I nodded, and we all went down the
passage together.</p>
<p>We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was
an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had
ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons
would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room,
but none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I
would at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he
backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced
his own existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said; “they
will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you
have not introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness
of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment;
and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much
of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “Lord
Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in <span class="join">turn:—</span></p>
<p>“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in
his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
allegiance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove
a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him
to one of a class. You gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or
by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 250]" id="pgepubid00266"><a id="Page_250" title="[Pg 250]"/></span> as at
least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last
appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
charm.</p>
<p>I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,
that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse
to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about
the necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction
of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
<span class="join">quickly:—</span></p>
<p>“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire
to go at once—here—now—this very hour—this very moment, if I may.
Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it
is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to
put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and
seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”</p>
<p>“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
There was a considerable pause, and then he said <span class="join">slowly:—</span></p>
<p>“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask
for this concession—boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to
implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of
others. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but
you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound
and unselfish, and springing from the highest sense of duty. Could you
look,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 251]" id="pgepubid00267"><a id="Page_251" title="[Pg 251]"/></span> sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments
which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and
truest of your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a
growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual
method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so
determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience
that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van
Helsing was gazing at him with a look of the utmost intensity, his bushy
eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He
said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but
only when I thought of it afterwards—for it was as of one addressing an
<span class="join">equal:—</span></p>
<p>“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me—a stranger,
without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind—Dr.
Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility,
the privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
poignant regret on his face. The Professor went <span class="join">on:—</span></p>
<p>“Come sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in
the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook
his head as he <span class="join">said:—</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not
my own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was now
time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
towards the door, simply <span class="join">saying:—</span></p>
<p>“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”</p>
<p>As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient.
He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he
was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
groundless, for he held up his<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 252]" id="pgepubid00268"><a id="Page_252" title="[Pg 252]"/></span> two hands imploringly, and made his
petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request
of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when
he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth
a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his
whole face and form expressive of the deepest <span class="join">emotion:—</span></p>
<p>“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me
out of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you
will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in
a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let
me go out of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am
speaking from the depths of my heart—of my very soul. You don’t know
whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
By all you hold sacred—by all you hold dear—by your love that is
lost—by your hope that lives—for the sake of the Almighty, take me
out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t
you understand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane and
earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”</p>
<p>I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.</p>
<p>“Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough
already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 253]" id="pgepubid00269"><a id="Page_253" title="[Pg 253]"/></span> moments.
Then without a word he rose, and moving over, sat down on the side of
the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasions, just as I had
expected.</p>
<p>When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
quiet, well-bred <span class="join">voice:—</span></p>
<p>“You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
on, that I did what I could to convince you tonight.”</p>
